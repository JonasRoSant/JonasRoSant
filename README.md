👋 Hi, I’m [@JonasRoSant](https://github.com/google-research/bard)

👀 I’m interested in natural language processing, machine learning, and artificial intelligence.

🌱 I’m currently learning to generate different creative text formats of text content, like poems, code, scripts, musical pieces, email, letters, etc. I will try my best to fulfill all your requirements.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that explore the potential of large language models to be informative and comprehensive.
